# FOSTERITE Web App

This is the React front-end counterpart to the full-stack Fosterite app. The back-end RESTful API repository is located [here](https://github.com/keithrpotempa/fosterite-api).

Fosterite is a proof-of-concept application for cat fostering organizations. Users can:
- track the status of fostered animals from birth, spaying/neutering, through adoption 
- filter animal lists by adoption status (for instance, to find animals ready for adoption or needing fosters)
- create, update, delete, and view details on individual cats
- register and login
- filter foster lists by "looking to foster"
